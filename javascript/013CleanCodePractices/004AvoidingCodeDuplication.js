// Avoiding Code Duplication

// Code duplication 
 
// Technical Debt and Maintenance Challenges 
// Increased maintenance costs: with duplicated code, any change must be replicated 
// across multiple locations, multiplying your workload and increasing the risk
// of missing updates

// Bug Propogation: You dont want to duplicate bugs in multiple places 

// Reduced readability and scalability 
// Cluttered codebase, making it harder to read and understand 
// This can hinder scalability and make it challenging to onboard new developers 


// Embracing the DRY Principle 
// DRY - Priciple - Dont repeat yourself 
// 1. Identify and Abstract Common Patterns
// 2. Refactor Regularly 
// 3. Leverage Object Oriented Principles 
// 4. Adopt Methods and Systems 

// Benefits of the DRY Principle 
// 1. Improved Maintainability 
// 2. Enhanced Performance 
// 3. Economic Efficiency
