// Why clean code matters 

// clean code is more than just functional code
// its about crafting code that is easy to read, maintain and extend 

// The foundation of software
// Clean code ensures that software remains a strength 
// rather than a liability. 

// It dictates how application function and perform, 
// making it essential for security, reliability and maintainability 


// Advantages for Developers
// Skill Development 
// Increased Productivity - reduces constant rework
// Positive work env - devs can focus on dev, not untangling random shit

// Benefits for Orgs
// Risk mitigation 
// Reduced Technical Debt
// Enhanced Developement Speed

// Challenges
// Clean code gets overlooked due to time constraints, budget pressures 

// Strategies for achieving clean code 
// keep it simple
// embrace test driven development (TDD)
// regular refractoring - allocate time for refactoring 
// adopt SOLID principles : follow the SOLID
// Code reviews and pair programming 

// Long-Term Benefits of clean code
// Lower Maintenance Costs
// Improved Readabiltiy 
// Better performance and scalability
